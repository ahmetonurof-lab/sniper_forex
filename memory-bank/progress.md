## MAXDD RESEARCH LINE — Per-Experiment Log

### Exp A — Concurrent Exposure Cap = 3 (C v1.0)

- **What tested:** cap the maximum number of concurrently open positions
  across the 6-major portfolio to 3.
- **Engine:** C v1.0 (`experiment/main_research_c_v1_0.py`, UNTOUCHED).
- **Dataset:** 6 majors (EURUSD, GBPUSD, GBPJPY, USDJPY, AUDUSD, USDCAD),
  2.7Y, 15m bars, full.
- **Isolated variable:** post-hoc portfolio overlay that rejects new
  entries when open-position count >= 3. Single lever.
- **Result:** 0 blocked entries. C2 baseline (2302T / +2875.00R / MaxDD
  8.00R / 2.73%) unchanged on every metric. Cap=3 never binding because
  max concurrent positions across the 6 majors never reached 3.
- **Decision:** **REJECT — non-binding / no strategic impact.**
- **Next test:** Exp B (3-loss circuit breaker).
- **File:** `experiment/exp_maxdd_A_concurrent_cap.py`.
- **Outputs:** `results/research/expA_concurrent_cap_summary.json`,
  `results/research/expA_concurrent_cap_trades.json`.

### Exp B — 3-Loss / 12-bar Circuit Breaker (C v1.0)

- **What tested:** after 3 consecutive CLOSED losses, block new entries
  for the next 12 x 15m bars (3 hours) on that symbol.
- **Engine:** C v1.0 (`experiment/main_research_c_v1_0.py`, UNTOUCHED).
- **Dataset:** 6 majors, 2.7Y, 15m bars, full.
- **Isolated variable:** entry-acceptance gate (per-symbol pause window
  after a 3-loss streak). Single lever.
- **Result:** 105 triggers, 0 blocked entries. All metrics identical to
  baseline (2302T / +2875.00R / MaxDD 8.00R / 2.73%). Per-trigger
  next-entry distance: min=26 bars, median=135, max=653; **zero** triggers
  had their next entry in (L_exit, L_exit+12]. The 12-bar (3-hour) pause
  window never coincides with a real entry signal because entry signals
  are sparse (~60+ bars between entries on the 6 majors).
- **Decision:** **REJECT — non-binding / no strategic impact.**
  Mechanically verified: 5/5 synthetic invariants PASS; function
  reproduces saved summary exactly per-symbol. Replay mechanism is
  correct; the lever is simply non-effective on this data/engine.
- **Next test:** Exp C (DD-based risk scaling).
- **File:** `experiment/exp_maxdd_B_streak_breaker.py`.
- **Outputs:** `results/research/expB_streak_breaker_summary.json`,
  `results/research/expB_streak_breaker_trades.json`.
- **Audit:** `experiment/audit_expB_replay.py` (5/5 synthetic PASS;
  per-symbol function output matches saved summary; 105/0 verified).
- **Replay causality note:** event stream sorts EXIT-before-ENTRY at the
  same bar. For `entry_bar == exit_bar` (hold_bars=0) trades, the EXIT is
  processed before that trade's ENTRY, so `t.trade_id in accepted` is
  False and the EXIT is excluded from the streak. Conscious causality
  rule, not a bug. Function's accepted-aware walk gives 105 triggers
  (authoritative); pure-EXIT walk gives 42.

### Exp C — DD-Based Risk Scaling (C v1.0)

- **What tested:** scale per-trade risk by current realized portfolio DD
  (post-hoc overlay). Thresholds: DD>2R x0.50, DD>4R x0.25, DD>6R pause.
- **Engine:** C v1.0 (`experiment/main_research_c_v1_0.py`, UNTOUCHED).
- **Dataset:** 6 majors, 2.7Y, 15m bars, full.
- **Isolated variable:** post-hoc per-trade pnl_r multiplier based on
  realized portfolio drawdown at trade entry. NO lookahead (DD from
  realized exits only). Single lever.
- **Result:** 0 paused. 2302T / +2827.55R / AvgR +1.2283 / PF 5.13 /
  MaxDD(R) 8.00 / **MaxDD(%) 1.85**. MaxDD(R) unchanged because the 8.00R
  drawdown is a single-trade loss step intrinsic to the engine; scaling
  the next trade's risk cannot shrink a pre-existing peak-to-trough.
  MaxDD% improved 2.73 → 1.85 (−32%) because the same 8.00R step is a
  smaller fraction of a higher equity peak after scaling. TotalR −1.65%
  (cost of the DD-scale leg). PF ticks up 5.08 → 5.13.
- **Decision:** **MaxDD% lever — PENDING PROMOTION to C v1.1.**
  Not auto-accepted: promotion requires a separate decision after
  standalone validation. MaxDD(R) is NOT reduced; only MaxDD(%) moves.
- **Next test:** Exp D (Open Exposure / Total-Risk Cap).
- **File:** `experiment/exp_maxdd_C_dd_risk_scaling.py`.
- **Outputs:** `results/research/expC_dd_risk_scaling_summary.json`,
  `results/research/expC_dd_risk_scaling_trades.json`.

### Exp D — Open Exposure / Total-Risk Cap (C v1.0) — NEXT

- **What tested:** TBD — cap on total open R exposure across the portfolio
  (or per-symbol), applied as a post-hoc entry-acceptance gate.
- **Engine:** C v1.0 (UNTOUCHED).
- **Dataset:** 6 majors, 2.7Y, 15m bars, full.
- **Isolated variable:** TBD.
- **Result:** pending.
- **Decision:** pending.
- **Next test:** Exp E (Time-of-Day Quality Filter).
- **File:** `experiment/exp_maxdd_D_open_exposure.py` (to be created).
- **Outputs:** `results/research/expD_*_summary.json`,
  `results/research/expD_*_trades.json` (to be created).

## HISTORICAL CONTEXT (preserved from earlier phases)

The sections below are kept for project history. They are not part of the
MaxDD research line but document earlier completed work (bootstrap, data
acquisition, LIVE↔BACKTEST parity, known-good benchmark freeze, etc.).

### C2 Baseline (full 2.7Y, 6-major) — AUTHORITATIVE

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Trades | 2302 |
| WR | 69.37% |
| TotalR | +2875.00R |
| AvgR | +1.2489 |
| PF | 5.08 |
| MaxDD | 8.00R |
| MaxDD% | 2.73% |

### KNOWN-GOOD FROZEN BENCHMARK — PURE D (2026-08-26)

- Benchmark ID: `PURE_D_FVG_ORIGIN_EQ`
- Artifact: `results/benchmark/PURE_D_FVG_ORIGIN_EQ_benchmark.json`
- Canonical engine: `experiment/main_research_d_v1_0.py` (UNCHANGED)
- Promotion rule: a new variant must beat this in head-to-head; if
  superseded it is archived, not deleted.

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Trades | 2847 |
| WR | 66.1% |
| TotalR | +2949.05R |
| AvgR | +1.0358 |
| PF | 4.05 |
| MaxDD | 7.36R |
| MaxDD% | 2.76% |

### MaxDD CHRONOLOGY FIX (2026-08-25) — COMPLETE

- Old `compute_stats()` sorted by `exit_bar_index` (symbol-local, not
  chronological across the portfolio). Fixed: sort by `exit_timestamp`.
- `BenchmarkTrade` got `exit_timestamp: float`; four close points now
  populate it. `compute_stats()` returns `max_dd_pct`. No strategy change.

### MaxDD STARTING_BALANCE FIX (2026-08-26) — COMPLETE

- MaxDD% was 100% because `equity` initialized at 0. Fixed: start at
  100R (`STARTING_BALANCE_R`). Affected: `main_research_c_v1_0.py`,
  `exp5f_frozen_vs_dynamic_eq.py`, `gemini_benchmark.py`. Commit 0561b22.

### DOCUMENTATION / NAMING — EQ C vs EQ D (2026-08-26) — COMPLETE

- Renames: `gemini_benchmark_eq.py` → `main_research_c_v1_0.py` (C = C2 EQ);
  `research_variant_D_fvg_origin_eq_pure.py` → `main_research_d_v1_0.py`
  (D = PURE D EQ). Created `docs/EQ_C_vs_EQ_D.md`. No logic changes.

### LIVE ↔ BACKTEST PARITY AUDIT (2026-08-22) — PASS

- TIME / DATA / EVENT / TRADE parity all PASS. Reference: dataset = naive
  MT5 server time; ICMarketsSC-Demo live server verified against dataset
  (account 53012914); period maps to UTC+3.
- Permanent rule: LIVE MT5 is the ground truth; backtest must reproduce it
  deterministically, not approximate it.

### INTERNAL SWEEP RESEARCH (2026-08-22) — CLOSED, BOTH VARIANTS REJECTED

- v1 (loose): 1262/1262 replayed, pass rate 97.62% (non-binding), p=0.075,
  H1/H2 sign flip → REJECT.
- v2 (MSS-anchored): chain ordering INVERTED vs hypothesis, p=0.75,
  filter would remove ~38% total R → REJECT.
- Permanent conclusion: minor HH/LL internal-sweep + MSS chain carries
  no incremental information in the NEXUS 15m entry structure. Line closed.

### KNOWN-GOOD BENCHMARK FREEZE (2026-08-22) — COMPLETE

- Direction-dispatch bug fixed (bullish/bearish normalized to long/short at
  execution boundary via `_norm_side()` in `trailing_adapter.py`).
  17/17 validation PASS. `src/` not modified.
- Frozen benchmark (98 symbols, 15m): 1471 → 1262 trades, WR 51.1% → 58.2%,
  +577.02R → +722.72R, PF 1.80 → 2.37, DD 27.17R → 12.73R (~53% reduction).
- Reference: `docs/KNOWN_GOOD_BENCHMARK.md`. **CRITICAL:** pre-fix
  execution numbers are INVALID as execution-behavior benchmarks.

### DD UNIVERSE AUDIT (2026-08-22) — COMPLETE (read-only)

- No symbol meets >=500-trade threshold. Max trades/symbol = 25, median ~16.
  Primary universe (MaxDD>=1.0% AND >=500 trades): 0 symbols.
- Audit: `scripts/audit_dd_universe.py` (read-only).

### Phase 0–4 (Bootstrap → Sweep Lifecycle) — COMPLETE

- Phase 0: Bootstrap (7/7 architecture validation, .env fix).
- Phase 1: MT5 real data probe.
- Phase 2A: Strategy spec (`docs/SNIPER_FOREX_STRATEGY_SPEC.md`, 377 lines).
- Phase 2B.2: Forex backtest infra (`src/backtest/`, 22 tests passing).
- Data: 98 symbols from MT5, 3,085,613 M1 bars, 2026-07-21 → 2026-08-20.
- Phase 3: Real-data strategy baseline (1845T, 59.3% WR, +1221R).
- Phase 3.2: Liquidity source forensics (CBDR vs SESSION_HL vs SWING_HL).
  SWING_HL highest WR/PF; CBDR NOT proven uniquely superior; 1-month data
  insufficient.
- Phase 4: Sweep lifecycle forensics — 1 sweep = 1 trade (100%).

### IC MARKET RAW → SERVER TIME CONVERSION (2026-08-23) — COMPLETE

- User-provided 6 majors in `data/icmarket_raw/` (UTC+0, cTrader).
  Converted to server time (UTC+2/3 DST-aware) in `data/icmarket_server/`.
  99.997% time-aligned vs MT5 feather pipeline; ~31% exact OHLC match
  (rest = feed/precision differences, expected).
- Scripts: `data/icmarket_raw/audit_icmarket_raw.py`,
  `data/icmarket_raw/cross_check_tz.py`,
  `data/icmarket_raw/convert_icmarket_utc_to_server.py`.

### RAW 1m DATA SOURCE INVESTIGATION (2026-08-22) — CANCELLED

- Dukascopy: fully blocked (network). HistData: bot-block. Yahoo: 7-day
  1m cap. MT5 demo: ~47-day cap. Twelve Data: chosen then cancelled.
  FXCM candledata: DNS dead. Resolution: user-provided ICMarkets raw
  (`data/icmarket_raw/`).
